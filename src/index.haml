      d3 language benchmark visualizations
    :markdown
        After reading [this blog post](http://blog.gmarceau.qc.ca/2009/05/speed-size-and-dependability-of.html) by Guillaume Marceau I was inspired to recreate his visualizations using d3.  Read more about the implementation in my response [here](http://compiledthoughts.couchand.com/2013/05/d3-langauge-graphs-a-la-marceau).

        Marceau's first graph overlays qualitative terms on a scatter plot of the benchmarks.  This is easy to do with d3 and svg.

        Marceau's next graph shows a static picture of the performance star for the Scala programming language.  My version highlights the interactivity of d3 with the language selection menu.

        Marceau then shows a matrix of all the languages' performance stars.  This is not difficult to do in d3, but all the dots sure give my browser's rendering engine a run for its money.  If you have a suggestion on making this more efficient, please submit a pull request!
    #allstars
    :markdown
        Marceau introduces a small multiples chart of the performance stars.  I think simplifying things by getting rid of the dots really brings out the character of the stars.  Marceau chooses to color the backgrounds by the presence of lambda-like features, as well as highlighting the c languages.

        I split things in a slightly more nuanced way, showing the divide between the four main camps.  Feel free to argue with me about the distinctions.

        That's all for now.  Fork and enjoy.
